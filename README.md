Distance Converter

A simple application to help you convert measurements of distance.

This app was designed to help those who want to find how long a certain unit of length is. Sometimes, we ask "How many feet is 54 inches?" and our app aims
to answer that and more. We provide eleven different units of length that you can convert from. You just enter a value, select a unit, and that value is
converted to eleven different units, including the one you initially chose. Units are mile, yard, meter, inch, feet, centimeter, millimeter, kilometer, micrometer,
nanometer, and nautical mile (used for measuring distances at sea).

Enjoy the app!
